## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first challenge, There isn`t so much I can talk about because I feel it was simple. First I did a Flowchart to have a simple idea of the tags I will use for the qr code, header and text. This help me wrote the code faster. Then I started with css, I always try to have a indent code to have a good practice for harders challengues in the future. First I go for flexbox, having a simple view of the things in the screen. Finally I did some changes, for example the margin of the p, to have the fist challengue complete.

Feel free to recommend me whatever you feel I need to change, and sorry for my english im for Argentina haha.

### Continued development

I feel I need to improve the use of display, I feel I don`t understand the using of block or flex-box at all.
